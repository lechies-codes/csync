# csync

`csync` is a simple Bash script that allows you to sync your music library using one command.
This is especially helpful if you download stuff a lot of songs or store playlists based on folders (more on that later).
This is primarily made for cmus, but you can edit the script to make it work for other players.

## Features to look forward to
`csync` syncs your library by editing your `lib.pl`, but soon it will be able to sync your playlists based on the folder it is in.
I'm not really sure if everyone stores their songs that way do let me know if you store it a different way and want that as a dedicated feature.
